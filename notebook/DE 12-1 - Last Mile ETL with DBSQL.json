					"# Last Mile ETL with Databricks SQL\n",
					"\n",
					"Before we continue, let's do a recap of some of the things we've learned so far:\n",
					"1. The Databricks workspace contains a suite of tools to simplify the data engineering development lifecycle\n",
					"1. Databricks notebooks allow users to mix SQL with other programming languages to define ETL workloads\n",
					"1. Delta Lake provides ACID compliant transactions and makes incremental data processing easy in the Lakehouse\n",
					"1. Delta Live Tables extends the SQL syntax to support many design patterns in the Lakehouse, and simplifies infrastructure deployment\n",
					"1. Multi-task jobs allows for full task orchestration, adding dependencies while scheduling a mix of notebooks and DLT pipelines\n",
					"1. Databricks SQL allows users to edit and execute SQL queries, build visualizations, and define dashboards\n",
					"1. Data Explorer simplifies managing Table ACLs, making Lakehouse data available to SQL analysts (soon to be expanded greatly by Unity Catalog)\n",
					"\n",
					"In this section, we'll focus on exploring more DBSQL functionality to support production workloads. \n",
					"\n",
					"We'll start by focusing on leveraging Databricks SQL to configure queries that support last mile ETL for analytics. Note that while we'll be using the Databricks SQL UI for this demo, SQL Warehouses <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/partners.html\" target=\"_blank\">integrate with a number of other tools to allow external query execution</a>, as well as having <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/sql/api/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">full API support for executing arbitrary queries programmatically</a>.\n",
					"\n",
					"From these query results, we'll generate a series of visualizations, which we'll combine into a dashboard.\n",
					"\n",
					"Finally, we'll walk through scheduling updates for queries and dashboards, and demonstrate setting alerts to help monitor the state of production datasets over time.\n",
					"\n",
					"## Learning Objectives\n",
					"By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
					"* Use Databricks SQL as a tool to support production ETL tasks backing analytic workloads\n",
					"* Configure SQL queries and visualizations with the Databricks SQL Editor\n",
					"* Create dashboards in Databricks SQL\n",
					"* Schedule updates for queries and dashboards\n",
					"* Set alerts for SQL queries"
