					"# Incremental Data Ingestion with Auto Loader\n",
					"\n",
					"Incremental ETL is important since it allows us to deal solely with new data that has been encountered since the last ingestion. Reliably processing only the new data reduces redundant processing and helps enterprises reliably scale data pipelines.\n",
					"\n",
					"The first step for any successful data lakehouse implementation is ingesting into a Delta Lake table from cloud storage. \n",
					"\n",
					"Historically, ingesting files from a data lake into a database has been a complicated process.\n",
					"\n",
					"Databricks Auto Loader provides an easy-to-use mechanism for incrementally and efficiently processing new data files as they arrive in cloud file storage. In this notebook, you'll see Auto Loader in action.\n",
					"\n",
					"![](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/autoloader-detection-modes.png)\n",
					"\n",
					"Due to the benefits and scalability that Auto Loader delivers, Databricks recommends its use as general **best practice** when ingesting data from cloud object storage.\n",
					"\n",
					"## Learning Objectives\n",
					"By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
					"* Execute Auto Loader code to incrementally ingest data from cloud storage to Delta Lake\n",
					"* Describe what happens when a new file arrives in a directory configured for Auto Loader\n",
					"* Query a table fed by a streaming Auto Loader query\n",
					"\n",

					"\n",
					"The following notebook will provide a more robust overview of Structured Streaming. If you wish to learn more about Auto Loader options, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.\n",
					"\n",
					"Note that when using Auto Loader with automatic <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader-schema.html\" target=\"_blank\">schema inference and evolution</a>, the 4 arguments shown here should allow ingestion of most datasets. These arguments are explained below.\n",
					"\n",
					"| argument | what it is | how it's used |\n",
					"| --- | --- | --- |\n",
					"| **`data_source`** | The directory of the source data | Auto Loader will detect new files as they arrive in this location and queue them for ingestion; passed to the **`.load()`** method |\n",
					"| **`source_format`** | The format of the source data |  While the format for all Auto Loader queries will be **`cloudFiles`**, the format of the source data should always be specified for the **`cloudFiles.format`** option |\n",
					"| **`table_name`** | The name of the target table | Spark Structured Streaming supports writing directly to Delta Lake tables by passing a table name as a string to the **`.table()`** method. Note that you can either append to an existing table or create a new table |\n",
					"| **`checkpoint_directory`** | The location for storing metadata about the stream | This argument is passed to the **`checkpointLocation`** and **`cloudFiles.schemaLocation`** options. Checkpoints keep track of streaming progress, while the schema location tracks updates to the fields in the source dataset |\n",
					"\n",
					"**NOTE**: The code below has been streamlined to demonstrate Auto Loader functionality. We'll see in later lessons that additional transformations can be applied to source data before saving them to Delta Lake."
