					"The instructions as detailed below are provided for groups of users to explore how Table ACLs on Databricks work. It leverages Databricks SQL and the Data Explorer to accomplish these tasks, and assumes that at least one user in the group has administrator status (or that an admin has previously configured permissions to allow proper permissions for users to create databases, tables, and views). \n",
					"\n",
					"As written, these instructions are for the admin user to complete. The following notebook will have a similar exercise for users to complete in pairs.\n",
					"\n",
					"## Learning Objectives\n",
					"By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
					"* Describe the default permissions for users and admins in DBSQL\n",
					"* Identify the default owner for databases, tables, and views created in DBSQL and change ownership\n",
					"* Use Data Explorer to navigate relational entities\n",
					"* Configure permissions for tables and views with Data Explorer\n",
					"* Configure minimal permissions to allow for table discovery and querying"

					"Note that at the moment these instructions are being written, Unity Catalog is not yet generally available. The 3 tier namespacing functionality it adds can be previewed to an extent by switching between the default **`hive_metastore`** and the **`sample`** catalog used for example dashboards and queries. Expect the Data Explorer UI and functionality to evolve as Unity Catalog is added to workspaces.\n",
					"\n",
					"## Configuring Permissions\n",
					"\n",
					"By default, admins will have the ability to view all objects registered to the metastore and will be able to control permissions for other users in the workspace. Users will default to having **no** permissions on anything registered to the metastore, other than objects that they create in DBSQL; note that before users can create any databases, tables, or views, they must have create and usage privileges specifically granted to them.\n",
					"\n",
					"Generally, permissions will be set using Groups that have been configured by an administrator, often by importing organizational structures from SCIM integration with a different identity provider. This lesson will explore Access Control Lists (ACLs) used to control permissions, but will use individuals rather than groups.\n",
					"\n",
					"## Table ACLs\n",
					"\n",
					"Databricks allows you to configure permissions for the following objects:\n",
					"\n",
					"| Object | Scope |\n",
					"| --- | --- |\n",
					"| CATALOG | controls access to the entire data catalog. |\n",
					"| DATABASE | controls access to a database. |\n",
					"| TABLE | controls access to a managed or external table. |\n",
					"| VIEW | controls access to SQL views. |\n",
					"| FUNCTION | controls access to a named function. |\n",
					"| ANY FILE | controls access to the underlying filesystem. Users granted access to ANY FILE can bypass the restrictions put on the catalog, databases, tables, and views by reading from the file system directly. |\n",
					"\n",
					"**NOTE**: At present, the **`ANY FILE`** object cannot be set from Data Explorer.\n",
					"\n",
					"## Granting Privileges\n",
					"\n",
					"Databricks admins and object owners can grant privileges according to the following rules:\n",
					"\n",
					"| Role | Can grant access privileges for |\n",
					"| --- | --- |\n",
					"| Databricks administrator | All objects in the catalog and the underlying filesystem. |\n",
					"| Catalog owner | All objects in the catalog. |\n",
					"| Database owner | All objects in the database. |\n",
					"| Table owner | Only the table (similar options for views and functions). |\n",
					"\n",
					"**NOTE**: At present, Data Explorer can only be used to modify ownership of databases, tables, and views. Catalog permissions can be set interactively with the SQL Query Editor.\n",
					"\n",
					"## Privileges\n",
					"\n",
					"The following privileges can be configured in Data Explorer:\n",
					"\n",
					"| Privilege | Ability |\n",
					"| --- | --- |\n",
					"| ALL PRIVILEGES | gives all privileges (is translated into all the below privileges). |\n",
					"| SELECT | gives read access to an object. |\n",
					"| MODIFY | gives ability to add, delete, and modify data to or from an object. |\n",
					"| READ_METADATA | gives ability to view an object and its metadata. |\n",
					"| USAGE | does not give any abilities, but is an additional requirement to perform any action on a database object. |\n",
					"| CREATE | gives ability to create an object (for example, a table in a database). |\n",
					"| CREATE_NAMED_FUNCTION | gives ability to create a named UDF in an existing catalog or schema. |"
