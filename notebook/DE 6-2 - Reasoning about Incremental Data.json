					"# Reasoning about Incremental Data\n",
					"\n",
					"Spark Structured Streaming extends the functionality of Apache Spark to allow for simplified configuration and bookkeeping when processing incremental datasets. In the past, much of the emphasis for streaming with big data has focused on reducing latency to provide near real time analytic insights. While Structured Streaming provides exceptional performance in achieving these goals, this lesson will focus more on the applications of incremental data processing.\n",
					"\n",
					"While incremental processing is not absolutely necessary to work successfully in the data lakehouse, our experience helping some of the world's largest companies derive insights from the world's largest datasets has led to the conclusion that many workloads can benefit substantially from an incremental processing approach. Many of the core features at the heart of Databricks have been optimized specifically to handle these ever-growing datasets.\n",
					"\n",
					"Consider the following datasets and use cases:\n",
					"* Data scientists need secure, de-identified, versioned access to frequently updated records in an operational database\n",
					"* Credit card transactions need to be compared to past customer behavior to identify and flag fraud\n",
					"* A multi-national retailer seeks to serve custom product recommendations using purchase history\n",
					"* Log files from distributed systems need to be analayzed to detect and respond to instabilities\n",
					"* Clickstream data from millions of online shoppers needs to be leveraged for A/B testing of UX\n",
					"\n",
					"The above are just a small sample of datasets that grow incrementally and infinitely over time.\n",
					"\n",
					"In this lesson, we'll explore the basics of working with Spark Structured Streaming to allow incremental processing of data. In the next lesson, we'll talk more about how this incremental processing model simplifies data processing in the data lakehouse.\n",
					"\n",
					"## Learning Objectives\n",
					"By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
					"* Describe the programming model used by Spark Structured Streaming\n",
					"* Configure required options to perform a streaming read on a source\n",
					"* Describe the requirements for end-to-end fault tolerance\n",
					"* Configure required options to perform a streaming write to a sink"

					"In the graphic above, a **data stream** describes any data source that grows over time. New data in a data stream might correspond to:\n",

					"* Updates to a database captured in a CDC feed\n",
					"* Events queued in a pub/sub messaging feed\n",
					"* A CSV file of sales closed the previous day\n",
					"\n",
					"Many organizations have traditionally taken an approach of reprocessing the entire source dataset each time they want to update their results. Another approach would be to write custom logic to only capture those files or records that have been added since the last time an update was run.\n",
					"\n",
					"Structured Streaming lets us define a query against the data source and automatically detect new records and propagate them through previously defined logic. \n",

					"## Basic Concepts\n",
					"\n",
					"- The developer defines an **input table** by configuring a streaming read against a **source**. The syntax for doing this is similar to working with static data.\n",
					"- A **query** is defined against the input table. Both the DataFrames API and Spark SQL can be used to easily define transformations and actions against the input table.\n",
					"- This logical query on the input table generates the **results table**. The results table contains the incremental state information of the stream.\n",
					"- The **output** of a streaming pipeline will persist updates to the results table by writing to an external **sink**. Generally, a sink will be a durable system such as files or a pub/sub messaging bus.\n",
					"- New rows are appended to the input table for each **trigger interval**. These new rows are essentially analogous to micro-batch transactions and will be automatically propagated through the results table to the sink.\n",

					"## End-to-end Fault Tolerance\n",
					"\n",
					"Structured Streaming ensures end-to-end exactly-once fault-tolerance guarantees through _checkpointing_ (discussed below) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging\" target=\"_blank\">Write Ahead Logs</a>.\n",
					"\n",
					"Structured Streaming sources, sinks, and the underlying execution engine work together to track the progress of stream processing. If a failure occurs, the streaming engine attempts to restart and/or reprocess the data.\n",
					"For best practices on recovering from a failed streaming query see <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/production.html#recover-from-query-failures\" target=\"_blank\">docs</a>.\n",
					"\n",
					"This approach _only_ works if the streaming source is replayable; replayable sources include cloud-based object storage and pub/sub messaging services.\n",
					"\n",
					"At a high level, the underlying streaming mechanism relies on a couple of approaches:\n",
					"\n",
					"* First, Structured Streaming uses checkpointing and write-ahead logs to record the offset range of data being processed during each trigger interval.\n",
					"* Next, the streaming sinks are designed to be _idempotent_ - that is, multiple writes of the same data (as identified by the offset) do _not_ result in duplicates being written to the sink.\n",
					"\n",
					"Taken together, replayable data sources and idempotent sinks allow Structured Streaming to ensure **end-to-end, exactly-once semantics** under any failure condition."
